> **"This was supposed to be fun!"**  
> Me, 3 hours into trying to be _dotfiles_-cool.

My attempt to shellscript my way through automating the setup of my next shiny computer. This is an evolving collection of config files, setup scripts, and personal preferences designed as a full environment bootstrapper.

I follow [@ThePrimeagen's](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) premise of convention over configuration (see [Attributions](#-attributions) below). Whenever I need to change a config, I edit the files in the repo and run [`config.sh`](/config.sh). I might switch approaches later, but this works well for now.

## :sparkles: What‚Äôs in here?

- ‚öôÔ∏è Config files for the tools I use
- üöÄ Install scripts for those tools
- üö∞ Script to hydrate (copy) config files
- üõ†Ô∏è Utils script for common operations
- üß™ A whole lot of trial and error

I'll keep adding things as the need arises.

## :man_technologist: Getting started (at your own risk)

**IMPORTANT:** These files are tailored for my machine, OS, and habits ‚Äî feel free to use/fork **(at your own risk)**, suggest changes, or just laugh at my choices.

Tested on:

![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-24.04.2%20LTS-ef5b24?logo=ubuntu&style=for-the-badge)
![GNOME](https://img.shields.io/badge/Desktop-GNOME%2046-4a86cf?logo=gnome&style=for-the-badge)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oatiffer/.dotfiles.git
```

### 2. Change into the cloned .dotfiles directory

```bash
cd .dotfiles
```

### 3. Set the `DOTFILES` environment variable to the absolute path of the cloned repo

```bash
export DOTFILES=cloned_repo_directory_path
```

For example, if you cloned the repo to `~/workspace/.dotfiles`, then:

```bash
export DOTFILES=$HOME/workspace/.dotfiles
```

**IMPORTANT:** The scripts won't run if you omit this step.

### 4. Run the installation script

```bash
./install.sh
```

This script runs all available scripts in the [`installs/`](/installs/) directory. You can run a specific install script by passing a name to [`install.sh`](/install.sh) as an argument. For example:

```bash
./install.sh docker
```

Will only run the docker installation script and skip the rest.

### 5. Run the configuration script

```bash
./config.sh
```

This script copies all configuration files to their expected locations under `~/` and places the tmux sessionizer scripts in `~/.local/my-scripts`.

### 6. Test before running (dry mode)

```bash
./install.sh --dry-run
```

or

```bash
./config.sh --dry-run
```

### 7. Load GNOME config (optional)

Use the GNOME extension manager to install the following extensions:

- Just Perfection
- Space Bar
- Switcher

Then run the [`gnome.sh`](/gnome.sh) script:

```bash
./gnome.sh
```

This script copies all desktop backgrounds in [`gnome-files/backgrounds/`](/gnome-files/backgrounds/) to `~/.local/share/backgrounds/` and loads [`gnome.dconf`](/gnome-files/gnome.dconf) to apply GNOME + extensions settings.
