# Dotfiles

> **"This was supposed to be fun!"**  
> Me, 3 hours into trying to be *dotfiles*-cool.

This is me learning how to use shell scripts (I knew very little when I started) to automate the setup of my next shiny computer. It’s an evolving collection of config files, setup scripts, and personal preferences that will hopefully become a full environment bootstrapper.

### What’s in here (for now)?

- 🐚 Install scripts for the tools I use
- ⚙️ Config files for those tools
- 🧪 A whole lot of trial and error

I'll keep adding things as I explore and learn more.

### People I took ideas from

- [@dwt1](https://gitlab.com/dwt1) – I learned a lot from him when I was considering using a bare repo for my dotfiles.
- [@ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) – I studied the scripts in his dotfiles repo line by line. Check out his [Dev Productivity](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/developer-productivity-v2/) course on **Frontend Masters**.

**NOTE:** I studied these repos to learn the concepts, syntax, and pick up ideas. The code you'll find here is my own (and ChatGPT's).

### Liability insurance

These files are tailored for my machine, OS, and habits — but feel free to use, fork, suggest changes, or just laugh at my choices.
